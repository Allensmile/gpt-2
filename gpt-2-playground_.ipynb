            "\n",
            "For those of you who aren't familiar with George's book (though I highly recommend it), the Great Migration is a major factor of our economic growth, even if it doesn't always occur the moment you begin to read it. This has been the subject of much attention among economists and policymakers with the increasing concern over the role the Great Migration has played through the years.\n",
            "\n",
            "The article explains how a \"big wave\" of immigration occurred during the Great Migration. During that wave, many of the country's fastest growing ethnic groups, including Muslims, Hispanics, Asians, and people of other political stripes began moving to the United States (this led to a sharp increase in migration in many areas). This has led to many of the country's fastest growing ethnic groups, whether they were born in the United States or in the rest of the world, migrating across the globe.\n",
            "\n",
            "What is the Great Migration doing? What about the other big-wave migrant flows since the 1990s? How will it affect American economic performance? How will Americans react, if anything, under the new immigration policies we're proposing? We'll talk a bit more about the latest issues, and how you can get updates on this story. In today's article, we'll also be writing about the Great Migration, what we're expecting with the economy, our hopes for economic growth, and what the ramifications of the new immigration policies will be for the United States, Europe, Africa, and beyond.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a follow-up to our recent coverage of the Great Migration, let me say that I didn't know how to respond to George's article, because, as it turns out, in the past the articles on these issues have always been on a slightly different topic.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Great American Migration has been a central focus of my recent articles, and my initial reaction to the Great Migration was not entirely positive. I was initially concerned that, given the large number of immigrants in America, there was more immigration to come, and given the high fertility rates we found, I wasn't quite sure if it made sense to continue making a bigger wave.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, of course, I started to read some of his writing, as well as this week's piece, where I discussed the Great Migration. I saw one significant difference between the two, and I thought, with one exception, that it didn't necessarily matter what I was comparing it to: I was saying an influx of immigrants to the United States during a period of high fertility rates.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, I decided to write about our first major change – the Great Migration - in my article The Great Migration. We will continue to be very critical of the Great Migration for various reasons, including those listed in the above, as we continue to move forward, while also giving you lots of information on what happened and why now that we know.\n",

            "\n",
            "With the Great Migration, there has been a significant increase in our domestic labor force over the period 2010 through2015, and the labor market's ability to adapt has been improved, in part thanks to the new immigration policies. As the country has become more diverse, fewer people from the United States are in the U.S., and more people from other countries are coming in due to the new immigration policies. The most commonly cited metric we used in our calculations – the number of Americans who have worked in the United States in three straight months – is estimated at between 5,200 and 8,400 immigrants per year (the figure on my blog is actually smaller).\n",

            "What we're getting from this is that more Americans have immigrated to the United States since 2010 than people from any other country did the last time we looked at it, and that this has largely been because Americans have increased their immigration into this country based on their skills and education. This leads us to wonder how much we're getting from immigration.\n",

That's the only way to escape any of this nonsense, the only way to stop everything, to live life in this way and that way; to be honest with yourself in all these difficult days.
